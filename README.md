# Data_Project_1
## Introduction
To analyze the crime dataset to identify trends, correlations, and patterns that can provide insights into crime rates, types, and distribution across different - -regions or time periods. The goal is to use this analysis to inform policy-making, improve law enforcement strategies, and enhance public safety.


## Summarize the key features of the dataset: number of records, types of crimes, time periods covered, and geographic locations.
- Identify any missing or inconsistent data and how it was handled.

## Crime Rate Trends
Analyzing the trends of crimes committed during the time frame from 202 to 2024. When analyzing the trends we see that most crimes are committed on a weekday compared to the weekend. While the "most popular" day to committ a crime was Friday. We can also see that the mojority of crimes are committed earlier in the year with Janurary being the hottest month for crime. We can also see from the data that most of the crimes committed during the years took place at night, between the hours of 6 pm and 6 am.

## Crime Type Distribution
- Break down the data by crime type to determine the most and least common crimes.
- Analyze trends within specific crime types (e.g., an increase in cybercrime over the years).

## Geographical Analysis
Examine the relationship between Geographical location and crime rates.
 ### Mapping Crime Distribution:
 Using tools like hvplot and heat map, crime incidents were mapped to visualize their distribution across the city.

 ### Crime Type Prevalence Analysis:
 Findings: The analysis showed that thefts were more prevalent at some locations than others.

 ### Correlation with 

 ### Challenges and Resolutions
 
 ### Key Results: 
 The geographical analysis successfully identified high-crime areas, correlated crime types with specific locations.
 ### Conclusions: 
 The findings support the need for targeted interventions in high-crime areas. 
## Demographic Analysis
 Examine the relationship between demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, descent) and crime rates.
### Can the data provide provide some insight if certain demographics are likely to be a victim of a crime? 
GENDER : The city's gender break down according to [U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey](https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/los-angeles-ca-population-by-gender/) shows just about an even split giving males a slight edge at 50.01% and females 49.99%.  Our analysis on victim data shows that males are at 47.1% and females at 41.9%.  This does appear to demonstrate that males have a sligtly higher chance of being a victim of a crime.

Age - The analysis was conducted by grouping victims into age groups, which provided a clearer overview of the data compared to analyzing each age individually. By also breaking down the data by gender, we were able to look for patterns where age and gender might come into play. When comparing the victim numbers with the city's population distribution by [age](https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/topic/los-angeles-ca-population/), we found that the proportions of victims closely mirror the age demographics of the city. Since these age groups constitute a larger share of the population, it is expected that the victim numbers would align with this distribution.

Race - The final demographic factor analyzed was race. Similar to age, the victim data closely mirrored the city's [racial](https://ctsi.ucla.edu/los-angeles-county-diversity) demographics. Hispanics, being the largest ethnic group in the city, also had the highest number of victims, followed by the White racial group. However, the data reveals an interesting observation. While Asians make up 11.72% of the population and Black/African Americans 8.63%, the victim percentages differ: Black/African Americans account for 15.99% of total victims, whereas Asians are at 4.56%. This suggests that victim numbers do not always align with the city's demographic makeup, indicating that other factors contribute to this disparity.

## Correlation Analysis
- Explore correlations between crime rates and other variables such as unemployment rates, education levels, and urbanization.
- Identify any strong correlations that could be useful for predicting crime patterns.

## Time of Day/Week Analysis
- Analyze when crimes are most likely to occur (e.g., day vs. night, weekdays vs. weekends).
- Identify any patterns related to specific time frames (e.g., more burglaries at night).

## Recommendations
- Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations for law enforcement, policy-makers, and community leaders.
_ Suggest strategies for crime prevention, resource allocation, and public safety improvements.

This structured analysis helps in understanding the dataset thoroughly, uncovering important insights, and making data-driven decisions to enhance public safety and crime prevention efforts
